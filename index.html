        <h1>Alejandro E. Rodriguez La Rosa</h1>
        <p>I am a fluent Spanish speaker. I was born and raised in Havana, Cuba.<br> After comming to US my passion for technology and curiosity for new <br> things skyrocketed. I attended William Fleming High School where 
           I became a member of the Spanish Honor Society in Roanoke, Virginia.<br> Earned some credits at Liberty University, until I found about Lambda School<br>
           and applied for the school. So far that has been the most mature and best decision of my life.  </p>
